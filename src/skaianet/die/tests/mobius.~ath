// As should be obvious if you run this program, it's nothing like Sollux's virus.

// Why?

// It's very difficult for a ~ATH interpreter to have that kind of result without having a bug, and most likely the
// reason that it worked for Sollux was that it exploited some obscure interpreter or compiler bug, which caused the
// computer to blow up.

// The interlacing of the lines doesn't actually get handled by the compiler here, so the RED (F00) thread loops
// infinitely around the outer loop (as the inner loop never starts due to the universe always existing), and the BLUE
// (00F) thread can't run anything so it just goes to the end and then terminates both of the threads.

// Boring. Oh well.
